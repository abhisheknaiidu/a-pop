[A-POP](https://a-pop.vercel.app/), is a HD Music Stream Application 🎧 built in order to provide high sound clarity to
respective Youtube or SoundCloud Songs, and that too without ads and video streaming! Just Music and Chill 😉
It's actually a hack for students, to listen to songs and bgm's from Youtube without even buffering data for video streams.

It is built using GraphQL, Apollo Client, Material-UI and obviously React!

API is being hosted on Heroku using Apollo Client!
